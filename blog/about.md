# About

## What am i writing about?
I want to couch down my various experiences vis-a-vis the current job market. After years of casual conversations with friends and colleagues, they have finally convinced me to make my experience publicly available. For better or for worse, i am giving it an honest shot.

## Specifically, what is it about?
That's where things get tricky. The job that i do is very lacking as far as titles go. Every other year a newfangled buzzword creeps up on us. Here's some of them in a more or less chronological order:

- Computer analyst
- Systems analyst
- Systems administrator
- Infrastructure engineer
- Subject Matter Expert (SME)
- DevOps engineer

Astute readers will know that those vague titles do have nebulous distinctions. Those, however, tend to be defined (and treated!) differently by each individual employer. As much as we may are about such distinctions, the vast majority of people do not.

## So titles don't mean much. What do you do?
Long story short: Design, architect, build, maintain and operate computational environments upon which a given business's applications are running. Usally achieved by working hand in hand with both the software developers and management needs. There are many other facets to the work, but that summarizes it concisely enough for a one-liner. 

## What qualifies you to write this at all?
Nothing. 10-ish years of experience in the field. A few key individuals asking me to do it. You pick! I have no illusions of grandeur or anything to prove here.
